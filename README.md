# Archipelago Manual - Five Nights at Fuckboy's: Complete Collection
## Notes
- This game's logic is made with each game's hardest difficulty in mind. This means Night XX for FNaFb1 and Proud for FNaFb2 and FNaFb3. **If you do not play on these difficulties, some items/checks may not exist and/or be more out of logic than possibly intended.**
- As of making this, the latest version of the Complete Collection is Version 1.2. If a version happens to release after this, please let me know so that I can look into it.
